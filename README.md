## Resources

Again, I had issues with trying to delete some extra images that I added to my images folder. I also took a long time finding a

</div>
```
tag for my hero-image on my website. Somehow I lost it while trying to clean up my code and I couldn't see the "schedule" section - the text was lost in the hero image. After lots and lots of troubleshooting (and part of the reason this assignment is late), I finally got the sections separate and visible.

###### I have read the points deduction list for this assignment.
